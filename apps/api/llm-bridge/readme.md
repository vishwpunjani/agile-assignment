🦙 Llama Bridge API (FastAPI & Ollama)
A high-performance FastAPI-based bridge that connects local applications to a customized Llama 3.2 model hosted on Hugging Face Spaces. This architecture acts as a secure proxy, managing requests and enforcing model parameters.

🏗️ System Architecture
The project follows a 3-tier architecture to ensure security and scalability:

Client (Terminal/UI): The user interface where prompts are entered.

FastAPI (Bridge): Local middleware that routes traffic, manages environments, and handles API logic.

Hugging Face (Core): The backend Ollama engine running a Dockerized Llama 3.2 model with custom Modelfile settings.

🚀 Quick Start
Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the bridge locally.

1. Prerequisites & Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies within a virtual environment:

Bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd llm_project

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # Windows
source .venv/bin/activate     # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Environment Configuration
Create a .env file in the root directory. You can use the .env.example as a template:

Code Snippet
OLLAMA_URL=https://your-own-link.hf.space/api/generate
MODEL_NAME=my-custom-model
Note: The .env file is ignored by Git to protect sensitive endpoints.

3. Running the Project
You will need two separate terminal windows:

Terminal 1: Start the FastAPI Server

Bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
Terminal 2: Start the Interactive Chat

Bash
python chat.py
🛠️ API Reference
If you wish to connect your own frontend or third-party tools, use the following endpoint:

Endpoint: POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask

Headers: Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:

JSON
{
  "prompt": "Explain the concept of neural networks in simple terms."
}
Interactive documentation is available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

⚙️ Model Configuration
The core model is pre-configured with the following parameters in the Modelfile:

Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent, logical responses)

Max Tokens: 300 (to ensure concise output)

System Prompt: Medium-level technical depth.
